# Healthcare Data Science Project – Bhutan
### --Using WHO Health Indicators to Support Mental Health Insights in Bhutan

This project is an end-to-end Python data science workflow built to analyze Bhutan’s national health indicators using official datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory (GHO).
Although the dataset covers many general health indicators (life expectancy, cholesterol, mortality rates, etc.), one long-term goal of this project is to use these indicators to support mental-health–related insights, such as understanding:
how lifestyle, non-communicable diseases, or demographic factors may correlate with mental health trends, how national health patterns evolve over time, which regions or years show unusual patterns that may relate to stress, wellbeing, or broader public-health conditions.

This project lays the technical foundation for future mental-health prediction and research tools in Bhutan.

## Project Objectives
Analyze official WHO health indicators for Bhutan

Build a reproducible Python data analysis pipeline

Perform data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Prepare datasets for future prediction models (e.g., forecasting life expectancy, identifying risk patterns)

Build a basic Streamlit dashboard to visualize health trends

Support longer-term goals of studying mental health from a scientific, data-driven perspective

## Dataset Source
All health indicators are taken from:

WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO)
🔗 https://data.humdata.org/dataset/who-data-for-btn

(official WHO dataset for Bhutan)

The dataset includes indicators such as:

Life expectancy

Mortality rates

Non-communicable disease metrics

Cholesterol and blood pressure values

Health law implementations

Environmental health metrics

These indicators help us understand broader public health patterns that may indirectly influence mental-health risks.
